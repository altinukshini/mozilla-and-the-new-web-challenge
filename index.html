			Currently we are a group of 2 people working on setting up Mozilla Louisville Community.<br />
			Mozilla Louisville is one of the Mozilla communities around the world, bringing together users, contributors, designers and developers.

			We are looking for people who have passion and are willing to funnel that passion to the Open Web and Open Source community. Mozilla also needs people who are willing to work on documentation, marketing, help with campaigns, give new ideas, and a variety of other interesting areas.

			We invite anybody that is interested to join us.
			By anybody, I mean non-programmers, those seeking to become programmers, and programmers alike. 

			This is our logo so far. New suggestions are welcome!

			Microsoft and Netscape were competing for the dominant of the web whereas Microsoft had more advantage on this bcs they bundled IE with windows OS along with some business practices, so Netscape was in trouble...

			Facing the growing monopoly of Microsoft, Netscape did something big, they put Netscape open source.
			By open sourcing the project, they were able to compete with Microsoft now in man power level.

			Source code might confusing and uninteresting to many people but freedom is something we can all understand and appreciate.

			The Mozilla project was created in 1998 with the release of the Netscape browser suite source code that was intended to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market. 

			Firefox was born in a time when the web became stagnant and the only browser out there was Internet Explorer
			
			In 2003, the Mozilla project created the Mozilla Foundation, an independent non-profit organization supported by individual donors and a variety of companies.

			It's not about the good guys and the bad guys, but the next moment you surf the web take a moment to think of those who made your internet experience possible.

			Without Mozilla, Internet Explorer would be the dominant browser and the web would be a corporate-only environment.

			We changed the way that you use the internet today and together with the other browsers such as Opera and other browsers we managed to kind of force IE to go by the rules of open web.

				Openness - Whether the protocols used are de facto or de-jure, they should either be documented with open specifications or open code.

			You can run Firefox OS on your own computer inside Firefox Nightly

			The easiest is to run it in the browser and build your apps for it

			You can put it on your own phones but the process is not easy (yet)
			The idea of Firefox OS is to bring new, affordable web-enabled phones

			However, when native apps took off a lot of companies realised that there 
			is money to be made by not keeping things open. Apps can do more than 
			HTML5 can because the OS and hardware providers grant them more access and
			control the experience. If you control the software and the hardware, you 
			can build great, but very bespoke products. If you allow for open technologies
			to be used, you lose control and you make less money as a hardware provider.
			As a developer, you shouldn't have to go that route.

			Firefox lately has gotten a lot of new features for developers far beyond

			A new feature in Firefox is the responsive view which makes it easy to 
			simulate different mobile device resolutions. This makes it much easier

			The responsive view in Firefox makes it easy to test what your app looks like
			in different resolutions and when you switch from landscape to portrait mode. 
			Instead of resizing the window you resize the document in the browser. It comes
			with lots of presets of the sizes of common phones and tablets and you still
			have access to all the buttons and tabs of your browser.

			The latest Firefox now allows for remote debugging, which means you 
			can develop on your desktop and see the results on your phone instead
			of having to send code, restart the phone or reload the page and all 
			that pain. With remote debugging you can see what is going on in the 
			code of your HTML5 app on your desktop while testing it in the real
			environment.

			The most frustrating part about this is that phone and operating 
			system providers lock out browsers and JavaScript. The fun parts
			to use in a smartphone are the camera, the sensors and to use it
			to send messages to your friends and call people. To do this, 
			however you'll need to write native code. Browsers, in general
			are locked out. This is not fair when you claim at the same 
			time that HTML5 is the platform to bring a great future.

			At arewemobileyet.com we have a live view of how far down the line

			As you can see we are very far down the line, the only thing 
			missing still is USB and NFC connectivity, other than that all 
			that is in your phone can be accessed by JavaScript.

			Firefox OS needs developers to help it out. You can contribute in many ways.
